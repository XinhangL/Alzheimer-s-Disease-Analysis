# 🧠 Alzheimer's Disease Drug Mechanism Analysis

This notebook explores a dataset of experimental and approved drugs used in the treatment of Alzheimer's Disease. The goal is to identify and compare drugs based on their mechanisms of action.

---

## 📌 Project Overview

- **Data**: A CSV file containing drugs, their mechanisms of action, clinical stages, and target systems
- **Focus**: Filter and display drugs that act on specific neurotransmitter receptors and transporters
- **Use Case**: Demonstrates medical data exploration, filtering, and visual style setup in Python

---

## 🧠 Key Concepts

- Data loading and preprocessing with `pandas`
- Filtering based on the mechanism of action using `df.loc[]`
- Visual setup for plotting with `matplotlib` and `seaborn`
- Domain-specific use of biomedical terminology
